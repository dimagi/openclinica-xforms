install dependencies:

sudo pip install -r pip-requires.txt



to convert a CRF xml export to xform:

> python crf_to_xform.py [-d] [-t translations.csv] crf.xml

crf.xml will be converted to xform and printed to stdout
use '-' for crf.xml to read from stdin

-d  dump a table of all text strings found in the crf to
    itext_dump.csv, suitable for manual translation

to add additional languages, edit the csv file. add a column for
each new language. set the language code as the column header,
and put the corresponding translation in each row. translations
may be omitted, in which case it will fall back to the default
language. in the future, this is also how you will associate
audio prompts, but that is not supported yet.

-t translations.csv  include the translations from the csv
     file into the xform



to run proxy:

> python proxy.py -u username -p password -f xform [--port port] openclinic_url

-u, -p  credentials to authenticate with web service
-f  xform file corresponding to the instances tablet is submitting
--port  listen port (default 8053)
url  root url of openlinica install
     (https://64.119.157.114:8070/OpenClinica-ws/ for staging server)

when proxy boots it will download the necessary WDSLs, then start
servicing requests from the tablet



to configure tablet:

set server url to url of proxy (including port)
